# Welcome! 

This is my (Katherine Li's) repository for my CS109 Challenge Project, "Do Horoscopes Work: Written in the Stars?"

You can find the code (in an .ipynb file with visuals!) under src/horoscope.ipynb.

The data I used are the two csv files "divorcios-2000-2015.csv" and "matrimonios-2000-2015.csv" under data/. There are some other data files under that folder as well, but I only used them to explore the dataset and didn't end up incorporating them into my challenge project.

Some outputs of my code are under results/. 

Thanks for a great quarter of CS 109 and for taking the time to look over my project!
